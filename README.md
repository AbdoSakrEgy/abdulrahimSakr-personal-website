## Install
GitHub is made up of repositories. A repository is a place where all files in a project can be stored, accessed, tracked, and modified. To download a repository, follow these steps:

1- Navigate to the GitHub repository page. If it’s a public repository, you can visit the page without logging in. If it’s a private repository, you’ll need to log in and have the proper permissions to access it.

2- On the main repository page, click the green Code button.

3- In the menu that appears, click Download ZIP. The entire repository will be downloaded to your device as a zipped file.

    $ cd abdulrahimSakr-personal-website
    $ npm i
    $ npm run dev
